Make Theme

The theme I used for this project is the "Make" theme. The reason I chose this theme is because it is relatively easy to use and navigate through. It also has a clean a simple design, which I feel allows for a better user experience on what could potentially be a very complex and messy user interface. The theme looks modern and allows enough customisation for it to be adapted to other client specifications.
